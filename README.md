# Responsive-Website
This is my personal landing page.

##Project description
This repository includes my personal landing page.This website was built on HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. I used CSS Grid 
principles to design a responsive interface. Also, this project has taught me how to design on smaller/mobile screens first.

## Next
I will continue to learn JavaScript and dive into React for my next project.
